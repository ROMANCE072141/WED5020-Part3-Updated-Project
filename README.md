## Project overview
This is a multi-page responsive website project. It demonstrates website structure, responsive styling, JavaScript interactions, form validation, basic on-page SEO, an embedded Google Maps search, and deployment preparation.

## Pages
- `index.html` — Home
- `about.html` — Organisation overview, mission, vision and interactive accordion
- `products.html` — Product categories, search/filter and image lightbox
- `enquiry.html` — Product/general enquiry form with client-side validation
- `contact.html` — Contact form, email-draft behaviour and embedded map

## Folder structure
- `styles/common.css` — Shared responsive styles and animations
- `js/script.js` — Navigation, accordion, product filter, lightbox, form validation and back-to-top behaviour
- `images/` — Product image assets
- `robots.txt` — Search engine crawler guidance
- `sitemap.xml` — List of public website pages for crawlers
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Record of work completed for each portfolio part

## Part 3 functionality
1. Responsive mobile navigation toggle and current-page indicator.
2. Accessible accordion for mission, vision and values.
3. Product search and category filtering.
4. Product image lightbox using the HTML dialog element.
5. CSS reveal animation and hover transitions, respecting reduced-motion preferences.
6. Enquiry form with HTML5 and JavaScript validation, automatic product selection, EmailJS email submission, and success/error messages.
7. Contact form with HTML5 and JavaScript validation, EmailJS email submission, and success/error messages.
8. Google Maps iframe embed and an external Google Maps link.
9. SEO title, description, keywords, author, robots metadata, semantic headings, alt text, descriptive internal links and sitemap/robots files.
10. Responsive layout and image lazy-loading.

## Form and deployment limitations

- The enquiry and contact forms use HTML5 and JavaScript validation to check user input before submission.
- EmailJS is integrated to send submitted enquiry and contact form information directly to the configured YEAST Artisan Bakery & Grocer email recipient.
- The enquiry form supports product enquiries and automatically selects the relevant product when accessed through the product enquiry links.
- Successful form submissions display confirmation messages, while unsuccessful submissions display error messages.
- Email delivery depends on the availability and correct configuration of the external EmailJS service.
- The Google Maps iframe provides an illustrative map location.
- SEO metadata, descriptive image alt text, sitemap.xml and robots.txt support search engine optimisation.
